# joplin-vieweb
A simple web viewer for [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) notes.

## Purpose
I'm going to use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) as a notes application.  
It's a long time I wanted for something like Joplin: opensource, not coupled to a web giant, and without infinite storage: storage has a price, we should pay for it.

Joplin-vieweb purpose is to provide an **online view of my Joplin notes**.  
It's running on a "Django server", running beside [Joplin terminal app](https://joplinapp.org/terminal/).
